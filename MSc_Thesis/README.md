# M.Sc. thesis Codes
These codes are implimentations of numerical approchese which used in this thesis.
For using xbraid, you must use Linux (or wsl for windows) and install:
- [MPI](https://www.mpich.org/),
- [HYPRE](https://github.com/hypre-space/hypre/),
- [XBraid](https://github.com/XBraid/xbraid/).

This thesis is based on:
